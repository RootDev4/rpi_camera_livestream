# raspberrypi_node_camera_web_streamer
Stream a realtime raspberry pi camera feed through an HTML web page

After many hours of searching on the web, I realized that, as prolific as raspberry pi's, cameras, and node.js are, there was no fusion of the three. This project can serve as a stand-alone video streamer or as a template for a much more complicated project.

Assuming you already have node.js installed, steps to install are:

1) Download the repo

2) Restore dependencies by running "npm -install" from within the folder of the repo

3) Start the server by running "node index.js"
